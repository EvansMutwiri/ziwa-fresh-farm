    <div id="about"><p>Ubuntu, loosely translated, embraces the concept of ‘human kindness’. Virtues such as compassion and humanity are fundamental to our ethos.
        
        We show that we care for our fellow human beings by giving time and resources to the disadvantaged that reach beyond our business interests. We understand that Ubuntu is essential for economic and environmental sustainability and that selfish behavior will result in growing poverty and environmental decay. There is interconnectivity between each individual, and between each individual and the environment. Ubuntu implies that the success of a company is dependent on utilizing and sharing each individual’s unique talents, skills and energy so that we continue to be a long-term employer, a positive force in the environmental struggle, invest in individual skills, ultimately benefiting the community. Ubuntu guides our conduct, rooted in the philosophy: What we do now and how we behave now will eventually affect the entire world.</p></div>
